    <h2>How do you calculate the distance between two airports?</h2>
    <p>Given two pairs of latitude and longitude, we calculate the great-circle distance using the <a href="https://community.esri.com/t5/coordinate-reference-systems-blog/distance-on-a-sphere-the-haversine-formula/ba-p/902128" target="_blank"><strong>haversine formula</strong></a>.</p>

    <h2>How do you calculate the shortest flight path?</h2>
    <p>This is an example of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which asks:</p>
    <blockquote>
      "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>Eight Wonders implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Held%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm" target="_blank"><strong>Held-Karp dynammic programming algorithm</strong></a> (iterative bottom-up approach with tabulation) to find an exact solution to the TSP. This finds the lowest-cost Hamiltonian cycle for an undirected symmetric graph. The time complexity is O(2^n*n^2). Every time the Itinerary Page is refreshed, this algorithm is executed in order to sort the destinations.</p>
    <p>The TSP can also be solved using a brute-force approach by finding all possible travel paths and choosing the shortest one. However, this naive implementation has a time complexity of O(n!) and is impractical for large n.</p>
    <p>For a quick approximation, we can choose a starting airport and sort the longitudes of the remaining ones. This could be inaccurate if we have three airports close in longitude, but the middle one is much farther south or north.</p>
    <p>The Ruby implementations for all three approaches are available on <a href="https://github.com/jasonherngwang/eight-wonders/blob/main/lib/shortest_path_algos.rb" target="_blank"><strong>Github</strong></a>. Comments and corrections are welcome. Heuristic and approximation algorithms were not explored, and may be needed if we increase the number of destinations.</p>

    <h2>Can I actually book a plane ticket for my itinerary?</h2>
    <p>Round-the-world tickets are limited to flights served by airlines within a single alliance. Therefore it's unlikely your itinerary is purchaseable as a single ticket, unless you specifically choose airports that meet the requirements. The airport data is from <a href="https://ourairports.com/data/" target="_blank"><strong>OurAirports</strong></a> and has been filtered down to 8,802 airports with IATA codes. Since not all of these are major airports served by many carriers, a random selection of them will probably not meet the requirements.</p>
    <p>For more information about round-the-world tickets, visit the three major airline alliances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://roundtheworld.staralliance.com/staralliance/en/round-the-world" target="_blank"><strong>Star Alliance</strong></a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.oneworld.com/world-travel" target="_blank"><strong>OneWorld</strong></a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.skyteam.com/en/round-the-world-planner" target="_blank"><strong>SkyTeam</strong></a> (currently not available)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Some requirements for round-the-world ticket itineraries include the following, which are not enforced by the Eight Wonders planning tool.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A maximum total travel distance</li>
      <li>Must continue in the same direction (eastward or westward)</li>
      <li>A maximum number of stopovers</li>
      <li>A maximum number of flight segments</li>
      <li>Some backtracking may be allowed</li>
      <li>Required to return to origin</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Can I redeem airline miles for a round-the-world flight?</h2>
    <p>Yes, some airlines will let you book round-the-world tickets (within their alliance) with miles. Probably the best and most flexible option is <a href="https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/amc/partner-flight-awards/around-the-world/" target="_blank"><strong>ANA Mileage Club</strong></a> (Star Alliance), transferrable from Amex Membership Rewards.</p>

    <h2>Is my itinerary private?</h2>
    <p>Itineraries are accessible by anyone with the 8-character itinerary code. Codes are generated using <a href="https://github.com/ai/nanoid" target="_blank"><strong>Nano ID</strong></a> whenever you create a new itinerary or copy an existing one. We do not offer password protection, but it is difficult to guess someone's itinerary code.</p>
