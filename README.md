Have you ever wanted to take off for a few months to travel around the world and experience all those places on your bucket list? We'd love to help you create an itinerary that minimizes time spent on the plane so you can do what you've always wanted to do. **Eight Wonders** is a flight path optimizer which calculates the shortest path that connects up to 8 airports, anywhere in the world. You can start an itinerary from scratch, or customize one of our favorites such as *Michelin Star Dining* or *Legendary Hikes*. All you have to do is enter the airport codes (we have a search bar) and maybe jot down some attractions you want to see. We'll automatically sort the airports in the optimal flight order, and you can use that to book your tickets. Bon voyage! :airplane:
