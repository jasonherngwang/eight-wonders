# Eight Wonders

https://eight-wonders.fly.dev/

**Eight Wonders** is a flight path optimizer which calculates the shortest path connecting up to 8 airports, anywhere in the world.

Have you ever dreamed about flying around the world to visit your bucket list destinations? We'll help you create an itinerary that minimizes time spent on the plane.
You can start an itinerary from scratch, or customize one of our favorites such as *Michelin Star Dining* or *Festivals!*. All you have to do is select 8 airport codes, and we'll automatically sort the airports in the optimal flight order. You can also make notes on the attractions you want to see at each place. Bon voyage! :airplane:

## How it Works

Eight Wonders is an optional project built halfway through the [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/) Core Curriculum, Ruby track. The material covered by this point includes fundamental Ruby syntax, OOP, closures, regex, testing, application packaging, deployment, networking, databases, HTML & CSS, and problem solving. I built this project to use what I've learned to make something fun.
